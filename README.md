# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub; on the road to becoming a better Web Developer and leading to becoming a Software Engineer.

  For about a year, in total, I worked as a web developer creating and implementing new features on websites with most of my workload pertaining to the maintenance of websites for non-profit and for-profit companies by way of multiple paid internships/apprenticeships. Then I went on to work as a Product Coordinator and I was promoted to Product Copywriter due to my integral part in building and restructuring an internal-use website for my co-workers and incoming Product Coordinators/soon to be co-workers for use while and after I trained them.
  Now I'm really delving into building websites and (leading to) building software from the ground up as I had only scratched the surface thus far and only regarding the usage of HTML, CSS, and a bit of Javascript. My aim is to gain a comprehensive understanding of working on the front and back end, becoming a well versed Full Stack Software Engineer, while I engage with other curious minds and collaborate on various projects.
