My first repository on GitHub; on the road to becoming a better Web Developer and leading to becoming a Software Engineer.

  I used to maintain websites for non-profit and for-profit companies in a various paid internships/apprenticeships, then I went on the work as a Product Coordinator and was promoted to Product Copywriter due to my integral part in building and restructuring an internal-use website for my co-workers and incoming Product Coordinators/soon to be co-workers for use while and after I trained them.
  Now I'm really delving into building websites and (leading to) software from the ground up as I had only scratched the surface thus far regarding my usage of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. My aim is to have a comprehensive understanding of working on the front and back end becoming a well versed Full Stack Software Engineer while I engage with other curious minds and collaborate on various projects.
